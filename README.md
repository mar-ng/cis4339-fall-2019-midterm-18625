# Exam 1, Fall 2019 Section 18625 

## Instructions

1) Add an h1 tag in the header div with the text "Exam 1, Section 18625, by \<your full name\>" (example: "Exam 1 by Keith Lancaster")

2) Using the appropriate helper function (as used in the practice exam), format the salary in the title index page to show the dollar sign and 2 digits after the decimal point.

3) Review all the pages in the application and make the appropriate changes so that no database IDs are displayed. 

4) Modify any forms with text fields that require database IDs to use dropdown menus.

5) Scaffold a model called Vendor with the fields last name, first name, region, and notes (all strings). The model should also reference the Shop model, so that a vendor is related to one shop and a shop could have many vendors. Modify the Vendor form so that when you create a new vendor, you can select a shop from a dropdown menu.
