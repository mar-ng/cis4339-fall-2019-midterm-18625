# Exam 1, Fall 2019 Section 19390

## Instructions

1) Add an h1 tag in the header div with the text "Exam 1 by \<your full name\>" (example: "Exam 1 by Keith Lancaster")

2) Using the appropriate helper function (as used in the practice exam), format the salary in the title index page to show the dollar sign and 2 digits after the decimal point.

3) Review all the pages in the application and make the appropriate changes so that no database IDs are displayed. 

4) Modify any forms with text fields that require database IDs to use dropdown menus.

5) Scaffold a model called Manager with the fields last name, first name, and district (all strings). The model should also reference the Shop model, so that a manager is in charge of one shop and a shop could have many managers. Modify the Manager form so that when you create a new manager, you can select a shop from a dropdown menu.
